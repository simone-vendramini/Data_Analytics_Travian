# Data Analysis of the Travian Game

This project analyzes data extracted from Travian, a popular real-time strategy game set in ancient Europe. Players manage villages, compete for dominance, and engage in key interactions such as attacks, trades, and communications. Our work focuses on understanding alliance dynamics, player interactions within alliances, and the movement of players across alliances.
